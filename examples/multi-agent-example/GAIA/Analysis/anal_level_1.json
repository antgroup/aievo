    "question": "Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.\n\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.",
    "analysis": "The riddle requires logical reasoning and probability analysis to determine which ball has the highest chance of being ejected by a piston. No external data or file processing is needed, as the problem is self-contained and relies on mathematical deduction. The solution involves modeling the platform dynamics and calculating probabilities based on piston firing patterns, which does not require tools like WebSearch or FileAnalyzer."

I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:\n\nmilk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts\n\nI need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.",
    "analysis": "The user requires a botanically accurate categorization of vegetables from a grocery list, avoiding any fruits. A Botanist agent is needed to distinguish vegetables (non-reproductive plant parts) from fruits (developed from flowers). The agent must analyze each item's botanical classification, excluding seeds, grains, or reproductive structures. The result requires alphabetization and strict adherence to scientific definitions."

    "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",
    "analysis": "The user's question presents a logical paradox requiring deduction based on the behavior of truth-tellers (humans) and liars (vampires). The solution hinges on analyzing the implications of the universal statement 'At least one of us is a human' under the constraints of truth-telling and lying. Since this is a self-contained logic puzzle with no external data dependencies, a ReasoningAgent capable of formal logical analysis would be required to deduce the number of vampires."

    "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",
    "analysis": "The translation requires applying provided linguistic rules and vocabulary specific to the fictional language Tizin. The structure of the sentence follows a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) order, with the verb 'Maktay' (present tense), the object (the liker) in accusative form 'Mato', and the subject (the liked item) in nominative form 'Apple'. No external data retrieval or file analysis is needed as all necessary information is explicitly given in the question."

Valid logical equivalences include De Morgan's Laws (1st and 2nd), contrapositive (3rd), implication-disjunction equivalence (4th and 6th), and the negation of implication (6th). The fifth statement, (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B), is invalid because ¬A → B converts to A ∨ B via material implication, which does not match A ∨ ¬B. This discrepancy makes it the only non-equivalent statement."
