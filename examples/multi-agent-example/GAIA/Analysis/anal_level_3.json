    "question": "In the NCATS PubChem compound database for Food Additive Status classification, find the compound that has a molecular weight of 100 g/mol or less, 6 heavy atoms, 1 or fewer hydrogen bond acceptors, and a complexity between 10 and 15. Of the shared gene-chemical co-occurrences between its two possible enzyme transformations, what is the PubChem CID of the heaviest by molecular weight?",
    "analysis": "The user's query requires querying the NCATS PubChem database with specific molecular filters and analyzing enzyme transformation data. A WebSearch agent is needed to access PubChem's public database and retrieve compounds matching the criteria (molecular weight ≤100 g/mol, 6 heavy atoms, ≤1 H-bond acceptor, complexity 10-15). A DataProcessor agent would then identify the compound, extract its enzyme transformation co-occurrences, and determine the heaviest PubChem CID by molecular weight. No local file analysis is required."

    "analysis": "The user is asking for a count of Twitter/X citations on English Wikipedia pages as of June 2023, aggregated by each day in August. This requires accessing historical Wikipedia data (June 2023 versions) to extract references, identify Twitter citations, and potentially link them to tweet dates. A WebSearcher agent would retrieve the Wikipedia page versions, a DataExtractor would parse references, and a TwitterAPI agent might resolve tweet dates for August aggregation."

    "question": "I read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.",
    "analysis": "The user is asking for the difference in measured time spans between two X-ray time profile diagrams from two different papers on Arxiv. This requires locating both papers via WebSearch, extracting the time spans from the diagrams, and computing the numerical difference. A WebSearcher agent is needed to retrieve the papers, and a DataExtractor or FileAnalyzer would parse the diagrams to obtain the specific time spans for comparison."

As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards?",
    "analysis": "The user is asking for a percentage of 1959 U.S. standards that have been superseded as of August 2023. This requires retrieving the original list of standards from 1959 documents, cross-referencing their current status (superseded or not) using official standards databases, and calculating the percentage. A WebSearcher agent is needed to locate both historical and current standards data, while a DataProcessor agent would compute the percentage.

    "question": "A 5-man group made up of one tank, one healer, and three DPS is doing a dungeon that was just released in World of Warcraft. Two are plate wearers and two are cloth wearers. At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it. If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?",
    "analysis": "The question requires logical deduction based on World of Warcraft class roles, armor types, and abilities. The solution involves analyzing clues about roles (tank/healer/DPS), armor types (plate/cloth), spell usage (holy, ice, fire, Metamorphosis), and loot restrictions (Kilt of the Forgotten One). A WebSearch agent is necessary to confirm class-specific details (e.g., which class uses Metamorphosis, armor types per class, and item class restrictions). A LogicSolver agent would process the constraints to deduce the valid class combination."

I lost my own reference sheet and need to know which of the papers each table came from. The file may not use the full table caption. If the references in the\"Trans fatty acid\" paper bibliography were numbered starting with 1, give me the numbers in the order that they would be used to fill the cells in the Excel file from top to bottom, as a comma separated list.",
    "analysis": "The user needs to map tables in an Excel file back to numbered references in the 'Trans fatty acid' paper. This requires analyzing the Excel file to identify partial table captions or identifiers, then cross-referencing these with the original paper's bibliography to determine corresponding reference numbers. A FileAnalyzer is needed to parse the Excel file's structure and content. If the bibliography of the 'Trans fatty acid' paper is not provided, a WebSearch agent may be required to retrieve it for mapping. However, since the user implies the references are numbered in the original paper's bibliography (not provided in the query), the primary tool is FileAnalyzer to extract table details, followed by logical inference to link tables to reference numbers based on available data."
