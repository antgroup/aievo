  "question": "Question: An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests. Based on the information in the document, who did not give a gift?\nFILENAME:cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb.docx",
  "analysis": "The question requires analyzing a document to determine which employee did not give a gift in a Secret Santa exchange. Since the document (FILENAME provided) contains the necessary data (employee profiles and gift details), a FileAnalyzer is essential. The Planner creates a strategy for extracting relevant information, and the Summarizer synthesizes findings to identify the missing gift. No external search is needed as all data is in the provided file.",

Next, the FileAnalyzer executes this plan to gather structured data. Finally, the Summarizer processes this data to deduce which employee's gift was missing (based on unmet recipient interests) and identifies the corresponding giver.",
