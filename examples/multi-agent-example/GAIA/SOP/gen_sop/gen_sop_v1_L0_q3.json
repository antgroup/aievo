Since this information is not commonly known and requires accessing external web data, a WebSearcher agent is necessary. The Planner will strategize the search approach, the WebSearcher will execute it using GOOGLE Search, and the Summarizer will compile the final answer.

Focus on GitHub's numpy/polynomials repository issues filtered by 'Regression' label and closed status. Look for the oldest issue and check its timeline for when the 'Regression' label was added.\n3. Analyze and Iterate:\nReview search results. If the information is insufficient, revise your search strategy with more specific terms (e.g., including 'label added date' or 'issue history').
