  "analysis": "The user's question requires analyzing a JSON-LD file to extract researcher identifiers (ORCID IDs) and calculating the average number of pre-2020 works listed on their ORCID pages. This necessitates a FileAnalyzer to parse the JSON-LD file, a WebSearcher to retrieve ORCID page data via web searches, and a Summarizer to compute the average.

The Planner analyzes the query and creates plans for file analysis and web research.\n2. The FileAnalyzer extracts ORCID identifiers from the JSON-LD file.\n3. The WebSearcher uses ORCID IDs to search for each researcher's ORCID page, collects their pre-2020 works via web searches, and counts them.\n4. The Summarizer calculates the average number of pre-2020 works across all researchers and returns the final result.",
