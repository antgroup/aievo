  "question": "Question: Who nominated the only Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016?",
  "analysis": "The user's question requires identifying a specific Wikipedia article about a dinosaur promoted as a Featured Article in November 2016 and finding its nominator. This involves two key steps: (1) searching for the correct article using historical Wikipedia data, and (2) navigating to the article's page to extract nomination details. Since the task requires both web search and interactive browsing (e.g., clicking links to access nomination history), a WebSearcher (for initial search) and WebBrowser (for page navigation) are necessary. The Planner and Summarizer ensure structured workflow and final synthesis.",

The WebSearcher identifies the correct article (e.g., Giganotosaurus) using historical data. The WebBrowser navigates to the article's page and retrieves nomination metadata. Finally, the Summarizer synthesizes the results into a final answer.",
