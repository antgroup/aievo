  "question": "Question: An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests. Based on the information in the document, who did not give a gift?\nFILENAME:cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb.docx",
  "analysis": "The user's question requires analyzing a document to determine who did not give a gift in a Secret Santa exchange. The problem involves matching gift details to recipient interests from the file, identifying missing recipients, and tracing back to the unassigned giver. Since the question explicitly references a document (FILENAME provided), the FileAnalyzer is essential. No web search or browser interaction is needed as the solution relies solely on file data. The Planner orchestrates the analysis strategy, the FileAnalyzer extracts structured data from the document, and the Summarizer deduces the missing giver through logical elimination.",

The FileAnalyzer then processes the provided document to extract employee profiles, gift assignments, and recipient interests. Finally, the Summarizer uses logical elimination to identify the missing gift giver by cross-referencing the list of employees, completed gift matches, and the unassigned recipient from the file data.",
