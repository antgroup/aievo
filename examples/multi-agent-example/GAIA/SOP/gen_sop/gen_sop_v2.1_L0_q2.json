  "question": "Question: In Nature journal's Scientific Reports conference proceedings from 2012, in the article that did not mention plasmons or plasmonics, what nano-compound is studied? Don't use the prefix nano in your answer if there is one.",
  "analysis": "The user's question requires searching for specific academic articles in a journal's conference proceedings, filtering by year, and analyzing content for keyword exclusion. The task involves web navigation (e.g., filtering, opening links) and content analysis, which necessitates a Planner to strategize, a WebSearcher for initial discovery, a WebBrowser for interactive site navigation, and a Summarizer to finalize the answer. No file analysis is required, so the FileAnalyzer is omitted.",

Second, the WebSearcher performs a Google search to identify the journal's URL. Third, the WebBrowser agent navigates the website to filter 2012 conference proceedings, opens each article, checks for exclusion of 'plasmon'/'plasmonic', and extracts the nano-compound (without the 'nano' prefix). Finally, the Summarizer synthesizes the findings to provide the final answer.",
