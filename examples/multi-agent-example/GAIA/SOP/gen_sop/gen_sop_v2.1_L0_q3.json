The WebSearcher locates the NumPy GitHub repository via Google search. The WebBrowser navigates through GitHub's interface to filter closed issues with specific labels, identifies the oldest issue, and extracts the Regression label's addition date. Finally, the Summarizer formats the date into MM/DD/YY and delivers the final answer.",
