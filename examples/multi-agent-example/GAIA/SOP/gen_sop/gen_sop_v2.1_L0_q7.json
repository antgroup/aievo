  "analysis": "The user's question requires accessing ScienceDirect's website to collect domain-specific Reference Works data, performing statistical calculations, and comparing results. The WebBrowser agent is essential for navigating the website and extracting dynamic data. The CalculationAgent handles standard deviation calculations and numerical operations, while the Planner and Summarizer orchestrate the workflow and finalize the answer.",
