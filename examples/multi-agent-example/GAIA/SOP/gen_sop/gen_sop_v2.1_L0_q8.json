  "analysis": "The user's question requires analyzing a JSONLD file containing ORCID IDs, accessing each ORCID page to count pre-2020 works, and calculating an average. This necessitates file analysis, web navigation, and data synthesis. The FileAnalyzer extracts ORCID IDs from the provided file. The WebBrowser agent navigates ORCID pages to collect work counts, as this requires direct web interaction. The Summarizer computes the average. The Planner coordinates the workflow.",

The Planner analyzes the user's query and creates a file analysis plan for the FileAnalyzer and a web navigation plan for the WebBrowser. 2. The FileAnalyzer extracts ORCID IDs from the provided JSONLD file. 3. The WebBrowser navigates to each ORCID page, filters works published before 2020, and records the counts. 4. The Summarizer calculates the average of these counts and delivers the final answer.",
