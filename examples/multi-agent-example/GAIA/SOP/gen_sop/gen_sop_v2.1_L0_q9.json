  "question": "Question: The Latin root of the Yola word \"gimlie\" shares a spelling with a Spanish word. What is the Google translation of the source title for the 1994 example sentence for that word in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online? Answer in plain text, without punctuation.",
  "analysis": "The user's question requires multiple steps involving web searches and navigating specific websites. First, the Latin root 'caminata' is found via Wiktionary using a web search. Next, the Collins dictionary entry for 'caminata' must be accessed to locate the 1994 example's source title. Finally, translating that title requires another search. The WebBrowser agent is necessary to interact with web pages (e.g., scrolling to specific examples), while the WebSearcher handles Google searches. The Planner coordinates the strategy, and the Summarizer compiles the final answer.",
