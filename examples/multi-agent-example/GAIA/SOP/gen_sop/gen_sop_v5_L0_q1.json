  "question": "Question: An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests. Based on the information in the document, who did not give a gift?\nFILENAME:cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb.docx",
  "analysis": "The user's question requires analyzing a document to determine who did not give a gift in a Secret Santa exchange. The problem involves parsing employee profiles, gift assignments, and recipient interests from the provided file. Since all necessary information is contained within the document and no external data is required, the WebSearcher agent is unnecessary. The workflow focuses on file analysis to match gifts with recipients' interests and identify the missing gift giver.",
