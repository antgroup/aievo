  "analysis": "The user's question requires searching through specific academic conference proceedings from 2012 in the Nature journal's Scientific Reports. Since the task involves locating articles via web navigation, filtering content, and extracting information from online sources, a WebSearcher agent is essential. The Planner orchestrates the search strategy, the WebSearcher executes multi-step web queries to identify the relevant article and extract the nano-compound name, and the Summarizer finalizes the answer. No file analysis is required, so the FileAnalyzer is omitted.",
