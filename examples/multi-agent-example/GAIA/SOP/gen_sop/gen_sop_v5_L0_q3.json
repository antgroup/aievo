  "analysis": "The user's question requires retrieving specific historical data from GitHub about a numpy.polynomial issue's Regression label addition date. This necessitates web search capabilities to access GitHub's issue tracker and extract the required information. The Planner will create a search strategy, the WebSearcher will execute the GitHub navigation and filtering process, and the Summarizer will format the final date answer. No file analysis is required since the data resides on GitHub, not in a provided document.",
