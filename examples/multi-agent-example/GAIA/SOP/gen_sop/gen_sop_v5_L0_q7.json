  "analysis": "The user's question requires extracting specific data from ScienceDirect and performing statistical calculations. Since the data is not commonly known and requires web scraping/up-to-date information, a WebSearcher is needed to gather Reference Works counts from ScienceDirect's Life Science and Health Sciences domains. The Planner creates a search strategy, the WebSearcher executes domain-specific searches and filters, and the Summarizer calculates the standard deviations and their difference. No FileAnalyzer is required as no file is provided.",
