The Planner creates a strategy to extract ORCID IDs from the file and gather pre-2020 works data. 2. The FileAnalyzer reads the JSONLD file to extract ORCID IDs. 3. The WebSearcher accesses each ORCID page, identifies works published before 2020, and records counts. 4. The Summarizer calculates the average of these counts and returns the final numerical result.",
