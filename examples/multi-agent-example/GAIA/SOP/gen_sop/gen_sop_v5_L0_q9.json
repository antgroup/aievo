Finally, search for the translation of that title using Google's Translate widget.\n2. Execute the Search:\nUse GOOGLE Search for each query. Format queries as comma-separated lists of key terms. Iterate if results are insufficient.\n3. Analyze and Iterate:\nReview search results. If the Collins dictionary page or example sentence is not found, refine the query (e.g., 'Collins caminata 1994 example'). For translation, search the source title text in Google Translate and extract the result.\n4. Compile Findings:\nOnce all data is gathered, pass the final translation result to the Summarizer.",
