  "question": "Question: An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests. Based on the information in the document, who did not give a gift?\nFILENAME:cffe0e32-c9a6-4c52-9877-78ceb4aaa9fb.docx",
  "analysis": "The user's question requires analyzing a document to determine who did not give a gift in a Secret Santa exchange. Since a filename is provided, a FileAnalyzer agent is necessary to extract the relevant data. The problem involves logical deduction based on matching gifts to recipient interests, which is self-contained within the document. No external web search is required, so the WebSearcher agent is omitted. The Planner orchestrates the file analysis strategy, the FileAnalyzer extracts the profiles and gift data, and the Summarizer deduces the missing giver through logical reasoning.",

Second, the FileAnalyzer processes the file to gather structured data about employees' likes, assigned Secret Santas, and gifts given. Finally, the Summarizer uses logical deduction to match gifts to recipients based on interests, identify the missing recipient (Rebecca), and determine who was assigned to give her a gift (Fred) by cross-referencing the Secret Santa assignments. **Important:** Do not request the User for any additional information.",
