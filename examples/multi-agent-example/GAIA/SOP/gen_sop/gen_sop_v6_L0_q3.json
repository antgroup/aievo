  "analysis": "The user's question requires retrieving a specific date from GitHub's issue tracker, which is not common knowledge and cannot be obtained from a file. This necessitates a web search strategy. The WebSearcher agent can use Google Search to find the oldest closed numpy.polynomial issue with the Regression label and extract the date the label was added. The Planner creates a search strategy, the WebSearcher executes it, and the Summarizer formats the date.",

Analyze and Iterate:\nReview search results. If the date (e.g., 'Apr 15, 2018') is found: Proceed to final formatting. If not: Revise search terms (e.g., 'numpy polynomial issue regression label added 2018') and repeat. Handle errors by adjusting query structure.",
