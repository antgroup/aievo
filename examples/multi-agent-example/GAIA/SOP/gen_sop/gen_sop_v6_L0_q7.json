  "analysis": "The user's question requires comparing sample standard deviations of Reference Works on ScienceDirect between Life Science domains and Health Sciences as of 2022. Since no file is provided, the FileAnalyzer is excluded. The WebSearcher is essential to gather specific data from ScienceDirect via Google Search. The Planner coordinates the search strategy, and the Summarizer calculates the final numerical answer. The workflow focuses on extracting raw data through web searches and performing mathematical computations to derive the required difference.",

The Planner analyzes the query and creates a step-by-step search strategy to collect data on Reference Works for Life Science domains and Health Sciences on ScienceDirect. 2. The WebSearcher executes Google Searches to retrieve the number of Reference Works per domain (filtered by 2022) for both categories. 3. The Summarizer calculates the sample standard deviations for both datasets, computes their difference, and rounds the result to three decimal places. **Important:** No file analysis is required, and all data must be sourced directly via web searches.",

Break down the user's query into actionable search tasks: identify Life Science domains on ScienceDirect, extract Reference Works counts filtered by 2022, and repeat for Health Sciences. 2. Define clear search parameters (e.g., 'ScienceDirect Life Science domain Reference Works count 2022') for each category. 3. Ensure the WebSearcher can retrieve raw numerical data per domain, not aggregated statistics. 4. Structure instructions to prioritize domains and handle potential data gaps.",
