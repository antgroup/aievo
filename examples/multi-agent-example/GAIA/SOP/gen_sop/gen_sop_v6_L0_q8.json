  "analysis": "The user's question requires analyzing a JSONLD file containing ORCID IDs to determine the average number of pre-2020 works listed on their ORCID pages. Since a file is provided, the FileAnalyzer is needed to extract ORCID IDs. The WebSearcher must then retrieve pre-2020 work counts from each ORCID page via Google Search. The Planner coordinates these tasks, and the Summarizer calculates the final average.",

The Planner analyzes the user's query and creates a plan for file analysis (extracting ORCID IDs) and web searching (finding pre-2020 works per ORCID). 2. The FileAnalyzer reads the JSONLD file to extract ORCID IDs. 3. The WebSearcher uses Google Search to locate each ORCID page and count pre-2020 works. 4. The Summarizer calculates the average of these counts and returns the final numeric result. **Important:** No additional user input is required.",
