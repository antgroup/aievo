  "question": "Question: Who nominated the only Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016?",
  "analysis": "The question requires identifying the nominator of a specific Wikipedia Featured Article about a dinosaur promoted in November 2016. This involves two key steps: (1) locating the exact article via historical Wikipedia data, and (2) tracing its nomination details. Since this requires external historical data and no files are provided, the team includes a Planner to strategize, a WebSearcher to execute sequential searches (first to identify the article, then its nominator), and a Summarizer to synthesize results. No FileAnalyzer is needed.",
