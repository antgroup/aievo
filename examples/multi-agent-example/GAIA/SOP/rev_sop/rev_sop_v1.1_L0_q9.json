  "question": "Question: The Latin root of the Yola word \"gimlie\" shares a spelling with a Spanish word. What is the Google translation of the source title for the 1994 example sentence for that word in the Collins Spanish-to-English dictionary online? Answer in plain text, without punctuation.",
  "analysis": "The task requires multi-step verification of etymological connections and strict temporal filtering. The revised SOP introduces validation checkpoints between agents, parallel hypothesis tracking, and mandatory year-specific search parameters to prevent premature conclusions.",
