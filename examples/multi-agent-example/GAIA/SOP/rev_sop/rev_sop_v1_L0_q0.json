  "question": "Question: Who nominated the only Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016?",
  "analysis": "The question requires identifying the nominator of a specific Wikipedia Featured Article about a dinosaur promoted in November 2016. This involves two key steps: (1) locating the exact article via historical Wikipedia data, and (2) tracing its nomination details. Since this requires external historical data and no files are provided, the team includes a Planner to strategize, a WebSearcher to execute sequential searches (first to identify the article, then its nominator), and a Summarizer to synthesize results. No FileAnalyzer is needed.",

Second, the WebSearcher follows this plan to directly access primary sources, first confirming the article's promotion in November 2016 and then extracting the nominator's username from the Talk page's nomination section. Finally, the Summarizer validates the consistency between the article and the nominator's name from primary sources before finalizing the answer.",

Follow the Planner's step-by-step instructions to identify the target article:\n   - First, search for 'Wikipedia Featured Article November 2016 dinosaur' to locate the article title, cross-referencing Wikipedia's Featured Article archive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Featured_content/Current_announcements) to confirm the promotion date.\n   - Next, directly visit the article's Wikipedia Talk page (e.g., 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:ArticleName') to locate the nomination thread dated November 2016, and extract the nominator's username from the archived discussion.\n2. Use the GOOGLE Search tool iteratively, ensuring that primary sources like Wikipedia's Featured Archive and Talk pages are accessed directly. For example, if the first search returns multiple candidates, use exact phrases like 'Featured Article November 2016' or 'Talk:ArticleName nominations' to narrow results.\n3. Cross-check the nominator's name with the article's nomination records in the Talk page to ensure accuracy.",
