The WebSearcher executes a tiered search (official site → cached PDFs → transit archives → news verification) and provides raw data to the Summarizer. The Summarizer cross-checks stop sequences across all available sources, validates May 2023 compliance, and rejects answers if data conflicts or gaps exist. If verification fails, the Summarizer triggers a feedback loop to WebSearcher for additional data collection.",
