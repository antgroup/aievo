  "analysis": "The user's question requires statistical analysis of data from ScienceDirect, involving specific numerical computation (standard deviations to 3 decimal places) and comparison between domains. This necessitates a web search to gather up-to-date data and a dedicated agent for statistical calculations. The workflow involves planning the search and analysis strategy, retrieving data, performing computations, and synthesizing the final answer.",

The Planner/WebSearcher creates and executes multi-path data acquisition strategies (public search, institutional API access, and collaboration requests) simultaneously.\n2. DataValidator performs continuous quality assessment against predefined thresholds (domain specificity, temporal relevance, structural completeness).\n3. If data fails validation, Planner/WebSearcher iterates search strategies with adjusted prioritization.\n4. Valid data flows to DataAnalyzer for statistical computations with documented precision controls.\n5. Summarizer delivers results with access methodology transparency and statistical interpretation.",
