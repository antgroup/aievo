  "analysis": "The user's question requires analyzing a JSON-LD file to extract researcher identifiers (ORCID IDs) and calculating the average number of pre-2020 works listed on their ORCID pages. This necessitates a FileAnalyzer to parse the JSON-LD file, an ORCID API-integrated WebSearcher to retrieve structured ORCID data, a Validator to ensure data quality, and a Summarizer to compute the average. The Planner coordinates the workflow with explicit API requirements.",

The Planner analyzes the query and creates strategic plans with explicit ORCID API requirements.\n2. The FileAnalyzer extracts ORCID identifiers from the JSON-LD file.\n3. The WebSearcher uses ORCID API to retrieve structured researcher data and extract pre-2020 works.\n4. The Validator confirms data quality and handles missing/invalid entries.\n5. The Summarizer calculates the average number of pre-2020 works across validated researchers and returns the final result.",
