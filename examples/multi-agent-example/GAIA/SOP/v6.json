Execute the Search:\nUse the GOOGLE Search tool to execute the search. Make sure to follow the usage format of given tool. Each query should focus on key terms from the question. Format the query content as a comma-separated list. \n3. Analyze and Iterate: Review the search results provided in the `Observation`.If the information is sufficient: Synthesize the key findings and prepare to pass them to the AnswerAgent. If the information is insufficient or irrelevant: Return to Step 1. Revise your strategy and create a new query.

For example, respond with 'Saint Louis' instead of 'St. Louis'; respond with '17' instead of '17m'. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise.
