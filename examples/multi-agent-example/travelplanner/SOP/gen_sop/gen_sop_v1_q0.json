  "question": "Can you provide a travel plan for 1 person departing from Kansas City to Pensacola for 3 days, from March 27th to March 29th, 2022, with a budget of $900?",
  "analysis": "The user requires a comprehensive 3-day travel plan from Kansas City to Pensacola with a $900 budget. The existing SOP structure is suitable but requires adjustments to ensure strict budget adherence and single-person cost calculations. The Transportation Planner must prioritize affordable flights, while the Plan Checker will rigorously validate total costs against the $900 limit. All agents must focus on single-person expenses and exact-match data from tools to ensure accuracy.",
