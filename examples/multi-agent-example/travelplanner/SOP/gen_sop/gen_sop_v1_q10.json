This logistical framework is then passed to the Accommodation Planner, Restaurant Planner, and Attractions Planner, who work in parallel to find the best options in their respective areas.

Finally, the Final Plan Summarizer receives the verified and refined plan to generate a comprehensive and user-friendly final travel itinerary in the specified format.",
