  "question": "Can you provide me with a 5-day travel plan for 2 people, starting from Asheville and exploring 2 cities in New York from March 13th to March 17th, 2022? Our budget is set at $4,700 and we would love to try local Mexican and Chinese cuisines during our trip.",
  "analysis": "The user requires a 5-day travel plan starting in Asheville, visiting two New York cities with a focus on Mexican/Chinese cuisine within a $4,700 budget. The existing SOP template aligns well but requires adjustments to emphasize destination selection in New York, dietary preference integration, and budget validation. Key modifications include: 1) Explicit instructions for selecting two cities in New York (e.g., NYC and Albany) using CitySearch, 2) Restaurant Planner instructions prioritizing Mexican/Chinese cuisine, 3) Plan Checker's CostEnquiry usage to validate total costs against budget across all agents. The workflow remains efficient for parallel processing while ensuring logical consistency checks.",
