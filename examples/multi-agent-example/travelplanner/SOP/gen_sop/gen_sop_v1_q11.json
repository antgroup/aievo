  "question": "Can you help me plan a one-week solo trip from Oklahoma City to Colorado, during which I'll be visiting 3 different cities? The trip will be from March 1st to March 7th, 2022, and I have a budget of $3,000.",
  "analysis": "The user's query requires a multi-agent system to plan a solo trip across three Colorado cities for one week with a $3,000 budget. The existing template's team structure and workflow are suitable but require adjustments to address the solo traveler's needs, budget constraints, and specific geographic focus. The Transportation Planner must prioritize inter-city routes within Colorado, while the Plan Checker must rigorously validate against the $3,000 budget. Agent instructions are updated to emphasize solo-traveler suitability and cost-efficiency.",

This framework establishes daily locations for planners. The Accommodation Planner secures budget-friendly solo accommodations, while the Restaurant Planner recommends cost-effective dining options suitable for solo travelers. The Attractions Planner identifies free/low-cost attractions. The Plan Checker validates the total cost against the $3,000 budget and ensures logical consistency. Finally, the Final Plan Summarizer compiles the verified plan into a detailed itinerary.",
