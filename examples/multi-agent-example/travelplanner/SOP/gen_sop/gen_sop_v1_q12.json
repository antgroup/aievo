  "question": "Could you draft a 5-day travel plan for a group of 4 departing from Memphis and venturing into 2 cities in Minnesota? Our travels are scheduled from March 1st to March 5th, 2022, and our budget is set at $13,800. We require accommodations that provide private rooms.",
  "analysis": "The existing SOP template provides a robust framework for multi-agent travel planning. This query requires minor adjustments to agent instructions to address the specific requirements of 2 Minnesota cities, group size of 4, private rooms requirement, and $13,800 budget. The core team structure remains effective, with enhanced focus on Minnesota-specific city selection, group accommodation verification, and budget management.",

This framework is passed to the Accommodation Planner (who confirms private rooms for 4), Restaurant Planner (who plans meals for 4 people), and Attractions Planner (who suggests free attractions in Minnesota cities). The Plan Checker verifies budget adherence ($13,800 total) and logistical consistency, while the Final Plan Summarizer generates the comprehensive itinerary.",
