  "analysis": "The user requires a 5-day Texas trip from Orlando with a $3,100 budget. The existing template covers all necessary aspects: transportation planning for inter-city movement, accommodation/restaurant/attraction planning for daily logistics, plan verification for consistency, and final summarization. Adjustments include specifying Texas city selection (e.g., Dallas and Houston), single-person optimization, and strict budget monitoring. The workflow remains sequential with parallel execution of accommodation/restaurant/attraction planning.",
