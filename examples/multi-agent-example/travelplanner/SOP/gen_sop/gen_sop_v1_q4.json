  "question": "Could you plan a 5-day solo trip for me? I'll be setting off from Santa Ana and intend to visit 2 different cities in Montana. The travel dates are from March 6th to March 10th, 2022, and my outlined budget is $3,600. I have no specific preferences about house rules, cuisine, accommodations, or transportation.",
  "analysis": "The user requires a 5-day solo trip from Santa Ana to two Montana cities with a $3,600 budget. The SOP follows the template structure but adapts to Montana-specific logistics. Key adjustments include: 1) Transportation Planner selects two Montana cities via CitySearch, 2) Plan Checker verifies total costs (including flights, accommodation, and meals) stay within budget using CostEnquiry, and 3) Attractions Planner focuses on free Montana attractions. The workflow ensures parallel planning of accommodations, restaurants, and attractions after transportation is defined, with strict budget adherence checks.",

Daily transportation between cities and local mobility (e.g., rental car) are determined. This framework guides parallel planning for accommodations, restaurants, and attractions. The Plan Checker validates geographic consistency, budget compliance ($3,600 total), and logical flow.
