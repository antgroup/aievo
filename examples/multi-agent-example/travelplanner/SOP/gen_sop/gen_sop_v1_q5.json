  "question": "Can you devise a travel plan that departs from Memphis and includes 2 cities in Pennsylvania? The trip is scheduled for 5 days from March 22nd to March 26th, 2022. The trip's total budget is $1,400.",
  "analysis": "The user requires a 5-day trip from Memphis visiting two Pennsylvania cities with a $1,400 budget. The existing SOP structure works well but requires adjustments to ensure Pennsylvania city selection and strict budget adherence. Transportation Planner must identify two PA cities using CitySearch, while Plan Checker must rigorously validate total costs against the fixed budget. Restaurant Planner needs to focus on cost-effective meal options to stay within budget.",

This framework is passed to the Accommodation Planner, Restaurant Planner, and Attractions Planner who work in parallel. The Plan Checker then validates the combined plan against the $1,400 budget and logical consistency, using CostEnquiry for verification. Finally, the Final Plan Summarizer compiles the approved plan into a detailed itinerary.",
