  "question": "Could you help create a 5-day travel itinerary, starting from Baton Rouge moving to 2 cities in Texas between March 1st and March 5th, 2022? This trip is for a solo traveler, who has set a budget of $2,300.",
  "analysis": "The user requires a 5-day Texas trip starting from Baton Rouge with a $2300 budget. The team structure from the template is reused with key adaptations: (1) Transportation Planner must identify 2 Texas cities and design a multi-city route; (2) All agents must accommodate solo traveler needs; (3) Plan Checker must rigorously validate against the specific budget constraint. The workflow remains sequential but adds special attention to inter-city transportation logistics and budget verification.",

Final Plan Summarizer -\u003e End.\n\nDescription:\nFirst, the Transportation Planner determines two Texas cities to visit and establishes the transportation sequence between Baton Rouge -\u003e City A -\u003e City B -\u003e Baton Rouge across 5 days. This framework defines daily locations for other planners. Accommodation, Restaurant, and Attractions Planners then work in parallel to find options matching the solo traveler's needs. The Plan Checker performs comprehensive validation including budget adherence (critical for $2300 constraint) and logistical consistency. Finally, the Final Plan Summarizer compiles all verified components into a cohesive itinerary with precise details.",
