  "analysis": "The user requires a 3-day travel plan from Washington to Orlando for two people with a $2000 budget and private room preferences. The existing template covers transportation, accommodation, meals, attractions, and budget verification. Key adjustments include emphasizing private room requirements in Accommodation Planner instructions, adding budget-specific checks in Plan Checker, and ensuring return trip logistics. The workflow remains efficient for this straightforward trip structure.",
