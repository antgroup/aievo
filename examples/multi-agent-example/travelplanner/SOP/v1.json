Accommodation Planner, Restaurant Planner, Attractions Planner -> Plan Checker;\n4. Plan Checker -> Final Plan Summarizer;\n5. Final Plan Summarizer -> End.\n\nDescription:\nFirst, the Transportation Planner analyzes the user's travel request to determine the primary mode of transportation (e.g., flights, self-driving) and establishes the location for each day of the trip. This logistical framework is then passed to the Accommodation Planner, Restaurant Planner, and Attractions Planner, who work in parallel to find the best options in their respective areas. Once their individual plans are complete, the Plan Checker reviews the combined itinerary for logical errors, inconsistencies, or missed details. Finally, the Final Plan Summarizer receives the verified and refined plan to generate a comprehensive and user-friendly final travel itinerary in the specified format.",
