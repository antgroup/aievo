Initially, he expresses a strong disdain for the holiday, viewing it as a time of financial burden and foolishness, and he shows a lack of interest in Christmas celebrations. This miserly nature highlights his reluctance to engage in festive activities and reflects his overall negativity towards the joy and warmth that Christmas represents.\n\nHowever, Christmas also prompts deep reflections for Scrooge, reminding him of its importance through the actions of his nephew and the spirits that visit him. Despite his initial rejection of the holiday, it becomes the catalyst for his transformation. As the story unfolds, Scrooge learns to embrace the spirit of Christmas, which leads him to appreciate the values of generosity and community.
