He is depicted as a covetous old sinner, characterized by his tight-fistedness and lack of generosity, often seen as the antagonist in the narrative. Scrooge works in a counting-house and is unsympathetic towards the poor, embodying a cynical view of the holiday season.\n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge undergoes a significant transformation, primarily during the Christmas season. His journey begins when he is visited by the ghost of Jacob Marley, who warns him about his fate and the need to change his ways. This encounter sets the stage for further supernatural visitations from the Spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. Through these encounters, Scrooge reflects on his life choices, experiences nostalgia and regret, and learns valuable lessons about generosity, compassion, and the importance of human connection.\n\nAs he interacts with the spirits, Scrooge observes scenes that evoke horror and reflection, particularly regarding the impact of his actions on others and the nature of wealth and relationships. He experiences emotional growth and ultimately vows to change his ways, embracing the spirit of Christmas. By Christmas Day, Scrooge transforms from a miser into a generous man, showing kindness and a newfound appreciation for the holiday and its associated cheerfulness. His character arc illustrates a profound moral transformation, making him a symbol of redemption and the potential for change.",
